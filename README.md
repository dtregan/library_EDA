Exploratory Data Analysis

Contains .ipynb file, x2 .csv files (books.csv and bookloans.csv) and an example of the generated .txt file (books_tasks_report.txt). Tasks outlined in the .ipynb file are outlined again below:

Tasks

1.
"Write code to produce a report of the frequency with which books have been loaned in reverse order
(the least frequent first). The report should indicate the number of times that books were loaned in
2019, along with their titles and author. The latter are required as there are some texts (classics in
some way) which will be retained even if they have proved unpopular."

2.
"Write code to produce a report of the most popular genres and sub-genres of books borrowed. This
will inform the library as to the interests of its readers and therefore may influence future purchasing
decisions."

3.
"Write code to produce a report of the average length of time that a user has a book on loan and the
proportion of users who have returned books late, together with the average late period."
